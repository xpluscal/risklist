# DeFi RiskList by Ensemble
A Crypto Asset Risk Framework. A collaborative effort of [Optyfi](https://opty.fi/) and [opentelos](https://www.opentelos.com/).

## Why
Risk is one of the most important metrics that is still in its infancy in the crypto market.
A dashboard which provides an overview of those metrics as well as a means to create your own metrics should meet a healthy demand. After all, the real opportunity is not finding the best yield, but finding the best risk-adjusted yields.

## Goal
Create a dashboard that is bringing in 3rd party metrics & creates its own metrics where necessary to give a good overview of crypto asset risk. The quality we want to achieve is depth and breadth, meaning: covering the most important projects with comprehensive hiqh quality metrics and covering as many projects as possible with simple affordable metrics.
